## The Material Design 3 Gap

For years, developers have been waiting for Google to release an official **Material Design 3 web components library**. While Material 3 (Material You) has been available for Android and Flutter, the web lacks a comprehensive **Material 3 Expressive implementation**.

**@banegasn/components** is the community-driven **Material 3 Expressive web components library** that fills this gap. It's open-source, actively maintained, and brings Google's beautiful Material 3 design language to web applications through framework-agnostic web components.

## ðŸŽ¨ What is Material 3 Expressive?

**Material 3 Expressive** is Google's evolution of Material Design, featuring dynamic colors, expressive typography, and fluid interactions that adapt to user preferences - the design system powering Google's latest products.

## Why This Material 3 Web Component Library?

**Framework-Agnostic** - Built with Lit and modern web standards. Works with Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript. These **Material 3 web components** are true standard web components (Custom Elements + Shadow DOM), ensuring compatibility across frameworks.

- **M3 Button** - All 5 Material 3 variants (Filled, Outlined, Text, Elevated, Tonal) with full accessibility
- **M3 Navigation Rail** - Collapsible Material 3 navigation with responsive behavior
